# RFID_PARKING_SYSTEM
This project controls a gate barrier using an SG90 servo motor based on RFID authentication. A scanned RFID card is checked against a whitelist. If matched, the gate opens for a few seconds with access granted indication. If not, access is denied, and the gate remains closed.(LEDs), audible (buzzer), and textual (LCD) indicators to guide the user.
# ðŸš— RFID Parking System

## Overview
This project implements an automated parking management system using RFID technology. It allows for seamless access control and security by verifying RFID tags. The system is designed to streamline parking operations in facilities by enabling quick and efficient vehicle entry and exit management.

## Tech Stack
- Arduino
- RFID reader module
- Excel for spreadsheet configuration
- Word for documentation

## Files Included
- `RFID_PARKING_SYSTEM.ino`: Arduino sketch for RFID tag reading and parking logic
- `RFID_PARKING_SYSTEM.docx`: Documentation covering system design and functionality
- `RFID_PARKING_SYSTEM.xlsx`: Pin mappings and system configurations
- `circuit_image (9).png`: Circuit diagram
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions

## Highlights
- Automated RFID-based parking management system
- Secure access control using unique RFID tags
- Easy-to-configure system with detailed documentation and mapping
- Visual circuit representation for clear hardware setup

## How It Works
- Vehicles equipped with RFID tags approach the parking system
- The RFID reader scans the tag to verify access credentials
- Access is granted or denied based on custom logic
- Pin mapping ensures proper connectivity between components
